If you have **not enabled Hierarchical Namespace**, then your storage account is **not a true Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account** — it is just a **Blob Storage account**, even if you try to use the `dfs.core.windows.net` endpoint.

## ❌ Consequences of Not Enabling Hierarchical Namespace

|Feature|Blob Storage (No HNS)|ADLS Gen2 (With HNS)|
|---|---|---|
|Use `dfs.core.windows.net` endpoint|❌ Not supported|✅ Supported|
|Directory & file-level access|❌ Flat namespace|✅ Hierarchical|
|File ACLs, rename, append, etc.|❌ Not available|✅ Fully supported|
|`abfss://` Spark paths|❌ Won’t work|✅ Required|
|Azure Synapse, Fabric, Power BI (lake)|Limited / ❌|✅ Full integration|

## ✅ What You Can Do Now

### Option 1: **Recreate the Storage Account with Hierarchical Namespace Enabled**

This is the **only** way to start using ADLS Gen2 features.

1. Go to **Azure Portal → Storage Accounts → Create**
2. In the **Advanced** tab:
    - ✅ Enable **Hierarchical namespace**
3. Proceed with standard creation
4. Now your account will support:
    - `dfs.core.windows.net` endpoints
    - ADLS Gen2 features
    - Spark `abfss://` mounts
    - Power BI Fabric integration

⚠️ **This setting is immutable.** You cannot enable HNS on an existing storage account.

### Option 2: Use It as Blob Storage Only

If you **do not need** ADLS Gen2 capabilities:

- Just use the **Blob endpoint**:
    
    ```Plain
    https://balasubramanian.blob.core.windows.net/landing
    ```
    
- And use tools that work with Blob flat namespace (e.g., upload/download, static website hosting, legacy pipelines)
- Don't use `abfss://`, `dfs.core`, or hierarchical directory APIs

But note:

> You cannot use this with Spark, Power BI Dataflows, Synapse, or Fabric as a Data Lake — those require HNS.

---

## ✅ Recommendation

If your end goal is to:

- Ingest data into a **Lakehouse in Fabric**
- Use **Power BI**, **Spark notebooks**, or **Parquet/Delta** format
- Automate pipelines, versioned directories, or structured layers (raw/bronze/silver/gold)

Then you **must**:

> 🎯 Create a new ADLS Gen2 account with HNS enabled

Would you like a deployment script to create such an account with best-practice naming and tiering? I can generate one using ARM, Bicep, or CLI.
