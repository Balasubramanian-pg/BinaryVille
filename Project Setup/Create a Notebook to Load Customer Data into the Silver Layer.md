Moving data from a raw Bronze layer to a clean Silver layer is a foundational process. The provided code is a great start, but let's break it down in detail, explaining not just the _what_, but the _why_ behind every command and concept.

## Building a Robust Bronze-to-Silver Transformation Notebook

This guide will expand upon the provided steps to create a production-quality PySpark notebook. We will transform raw customer data from our Bronze Lakehouse, apply a series of critical business and data quality rules, and load it into a clean, structured `silver_customers` table using an incremental and idempotent process.

### The "Why": The Critical Role of the Bronze-to-Silver Notebook

This notebook is the heart of the "T" (Transform) in our ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process. Its purpose is to elevate the data from its raw state to a state of high quality and business relevance.

- **From Raw to Refined:** We convert raw, unfiltered data into a trustworthy dataset.
- **Enforcing Data Quality:** We programmatically apply rules to ensure data is valid (correct age, valid email), complete (no nulls in key fields), and consistent.
- **Applying Business Logic:** We enrich the data by adding business-driven context, like the `customer_segment`, which isn't present in the source system.
- **Efficiency:** By using an incremental loading pattern, we only process new or changed data, saving significant compute costs and time compared to reprocessing the entire dataset every time.

### Step-by-Step Guide with Detailed Explanations

### Prerequisites

- A **Bronze Lakehouse** (e.g., `LH_Bronze`) containing the raw `customer` table. **Crucially, this Bronze table must have a timestamp column (e.g.,** `**ingestion_timestamp**`**) that marks when each row was ingested.**
- An empty **Silver Lakehouse** (e.g., `LH_Silver`) where the cleaned table will be stored.

---

### Step 1, 2, & 3: Navigate and Create the Notebook

1. **Log in to Microsoft Fabric:** Access the [Fabric portal](https://fabric.microsoft.com/).
2. **Navigate to the Silver Lakehouse:** Open your workspace and select your `LH_Silver` Lakehouse.
3. **Create a New Notebook:**
    - From within the `LH_Silver` Lakehouse view, click **Open notebook > New notebook**. This automatically attaches the notebook to this Lakehouse, making it easier to read from and write to it.
    - Give it a clear, descriptive name: `Ntbk_Bronze_to_Silver_Customers`.

### Notebook Implementation: A Cell-by-Cell Breakdown

Let's walk through the code, cell by cell, explaining each command in detail.

### Cell 1: Define the Target Silver Table Schema

```Python
# Cell 1: Create the target table in the Silver Lakehouse if it doesn't already exist.

spark.sql("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS LH_Silver.silver_customers (
        customer_id STRING,
        name STRING,
        email STRING,
        country STRING,
        customer_type STRING,
        registration_date DATE,
        age INT,
        gender STRING,
        total_purchases DECIMAL(10, 2), -- Using Decimal for currency is a best practice
        customer_segment STRING,
        days_since_registration INT,
        last_updated TIMESTAMP
    )
    USING DELTA
""")
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- `**CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS**`: This makes the script **idempotent**, meaning you can run it multiple times without causing an error. If the `silver_customers` table already exists, this command does nothing; otherwise, it creates it.
- `**LH_Silver.silver_customers**`: We use a three-part name (`Lakehouse.Table`) to be explicit about where we are creating this table. This avoids ambiguity.
- **Defining Schema Upfront**: We are pre-defining the exact structure (column names and data types) of our target table. This is a core concept of **schema-on-write**, which enforces data quality. If our transformation accidentally produces data in the wrong format (e.g., a string where an integer should be), the final write will fail, protecting our clean Silver table from corruption.
- **New/Transformed Columns**:
    - `total_purchases DECIMAL(10, 2)`: We've chosen `Decimal` instead of `INT` as it's the standard for financial data, allowing for cents.
    - `customer_segment`, `days_since_registration`: These are the new columns we will calculate.
    - `last_updated`: A crucial auditing column. It will store the timestamp of when a given record was last processed and loaded into the Silver table.
- `**USING DELTA**`: This explicitly states we are creating a **Delta Lake table**, which gives us ACID transactions, time travel, and the powerful `MERGE` capability we'll use later. In Fabric Lakehouses, Delta is the default, but being explicit is good practice.

---

### Cell 2: Get the Last Processed Timestamp for Incremental Loading

```Python
# Cell 2: Determine the starting point for our incremental load.

# Query the Silver table to find the most recent 'last_updated' timestamp.
last_processed_df = spark.sql("SELECT MAX(last_updated) as last_processed FROM LH_Silver.silver_customers")
last_processed_timestamp = last_processed_df.collect()[0]['last_processed']

# If the table is empty (first run), the timestamp will be None.
# In that case, we set a very old default timestamp to ensure we load all historical data.
if last_processed_timestamp is None:
    last_processed_timestamp = "1900-01-01T00:00:00.000+00:00"

print(f"Processing data ingested after: {last_processed_timestamp}")
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **The Goal**: We want to avoid reprocessing the entire Bronze table. This cell finds the "high-water mark" â€” the timestamp of the very last record we processed in the previous run.
- `spark.sql(...)`: We query our target `silver_customers` table to get the maximum `last_updated` value.
- `.collect()[0]['last_processed']`: This is a standard PySpark pattern to extract a single value from a DataFrame.
    - `.collect()`: Pulls the entire result of the query (which is just one row in this case) from the distributed Spark workers to the main driver node. **Warning:** Only use `.collect()` on very small DataFrames.
    - `[0]`: Gets the first (and only) row from the collected list.
    - `['last_processed']`: Accesses the value in that row by its column name.
- **The "First Run" Problem**: The `if last_processed_timestamp is None:` block is critical. On the very first run, the `silver_customers` table is empty, so `MAX(last_updated)` returns `NULL`. This code handles that by setting the timestamp to a historical date, guaranteeing that all records from the Bronze table will be selected.

---

### Cell 3: Load New Data from the Bronze Layer

```Python
# Cell 3: Read only the new or updated data from the Bronze layer into a temporary view.

# Assume the Bronze table is LH_Bronze.customer and has a column 'ingestion_timestamp'
bronze_df = spark.read.table("LH_Bronze.customer")

# Filter the DataFrame for records newer than our last processed timestamp
incremental_bronze_df = bronze_df.filter(f"ingestion_timestamp > '{last_processed_timestamp}'")

# Create a temporary view to easily query this incremental data with SQL in the next step
incremental_bronze_df.createOrReplaceTempView("bronze_incremental_view")
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- `spark.read.table("LH_Bronze.customer")`: This reads the entire Bronze customer table into a Spark DataFrame. Spark does this lazily; it doesn't actually move the data yet.
- `.filter(f"...")`: This is the core of the incremental logic. It applies a filter to the DataFrame, keeping only the rows where the `ingestion_timestamp` is more recent than our `last_processed_timestamp`.
- `createOrReplaceTempView("bronze_incremental_view")`: This is a powerful Spark feature. It creates a temporary, session-level "table" named `bronze_incremental_view` that points to our filtered DataFrame (`incremental_bronze_df`). This allows us to use standard SQL in the next step to perform our complex transformations, which is often easier to read and write than the equivalent PySpark DataFrame API code. It does not write any data to storage; it's just a logical pointer.

### Cell 4: Apply Transformations and Data Quality Rules

```Python
# Cell 4: Apply all business logic and data cleansing rules using SQL on our temporary view.

silver_incremental_df = spark.sql("""
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        name,
        email,
        country,
        customer_type,
        CAST(registration_date AS DATE) as registration_date,
        age,
        gender,
        total_purchases,

        -- Rule 3: Customer Segmentation
        CASE
            WHEN total_purchases > 10000 THEN 'High Value'
            WHEN total_purchases > 5000 THEN 'Medium Value'
            ELSE 'Low Value'
        END AS customer_segment,

        -- Rule 4: Calculate Days Since Registration
        DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), registration_date) AS days_since_registration,

        -- Generate the new timestamp for this processing run
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS last_updated

    FROM bronze_incremental_view

    -- Rule 1, 2, & 5: Data Quality Filtering
    WHERE
        email IS NOT NULL AND email LIKE '%@%.%' -- A slightly better email check
        AND age BETWEEN 18 AND 100
        AND total_purchases >= 0
""")

# Create another temporary view for the final, clean data, ready for merging.
silver_incremental_df.createOrReplaceTempView("silver_incremental_upserts")
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- `**SELECT ... FROM bronze_incremental_view**`: We are now querying only the new batch of data.
- **Business Logic (**`**CASE**`**,** `**DATEDIFF**`**)**: This is where we implement the specific transformation rules. The `CASE` statement creates the `customer_segment`, and `DATEDIFF` calculates the registration duration.
- **Data Quality (**`**WHERE**` **clause)**: This clause acts as a filter, effectively dropping any rows that don't meet our quality standards:
    - `email IS NOT NULL AND email LIKE '%@%.%'`: A simple but effective check to ensure the email exists and has a plausible format.
    - `age BETWEEN 18 AND 100`: Filters out records with invalid ages.
    - `total_purchases >= 0`: Removes junk records with negative purchase amounts.
- `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS last_updated`: We generate a _new_ timestamp for this batch. This value will become the "high-water mark" for the _next_ run.

---

### Cell 5: Merge Data into the Silver Layer (Upsert)

```Python
# Cell 5: Use the powerful MERGE command to upsert the transformed data into the final Silver table.

spark.sql("""
    MERGE INTO LH_Silver.silver_customers target
    USING silver_incremental_upserts source
    ON target.customer_id = source.customer_id

    -- If a customer record already exists, update all of its fields.
    WHEN MATCHED THEN
        UPDATE SET *

    -- If the customer is new, insert it as a new record.
    WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
        INSERT *
""")
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- `**MERGE INTO**`: This is the most efficient and robust way to handle updates and inserts simultaneously (an "upsert"). It's a cornerstone of modern data warehousing.
- `**target**` **and** `**source**`: We define aliases for our destination table (`target`) and the temporary view containing our clean data (`source`).
- `**ON target.customer_id = source.customer_id**`: This is the join condition. The `MERGE` command uses this to determine if a record from the `source` already exists in the `target`. **This requires** `**customer_id**` **to be a unique key for your customers.**
- `**WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET ***`: If a `customer_id` from the source is found in the target table, this clause is executed. `UPDATE SET *` is a convenient shortcut to update all columns in the target row with the values from the corresponding source row.
- `**WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT ***`: If a `customer_id` from the source is _not_ found in the target, it's considered a new customer. This clause inserts the entire new row from the source into the target table.

---

### Cell 6: Verify and Conclude

```Python
# Cell 6: Perform a final check to confirm the data has been loaded.

print("Merge operation complete.")
print("Verifying data in silver_customers table:")

# Display the total count and a sample of the data.
final_count = spark.sql("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM LH_Silver.silver_customers").collect()[0][0]
print(f"Total rows in silver_customers: {final_count}")

spark.sql("SELECT * FROM LH_Silver.silver_customers ORDER BY last_updated DESC LIMIT 10").show()
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Trust, but Verify**: A pipeline isn't complete until you've verified its output.
- `**COUNT(*)**`: We get a final count of the table to ensure it's growing as expected.
- `**ORDER BY last_updated DESC LIMIT 10**`: This is a great verification query. It shows you the 10 most recently processed records, allowing you to quickly inspect the results of the latest run, including the new `customer_segment` and `days_since_registration` columns.

### Final Thoughts and Automation

You have now built a powerful, reusable, and efficient notebook for transforming and cleansing your customer data. This process ensures that your Silver layer is a high-quality, reliable source of truth for all downstream analytics and reporting.

**Next Steps:**

The next logical step is to **automate this notebook**. Manually running it is fine for development, but in production, you'll want it to run on a schedule. You can achieve this by:

1. Creating a new **Data Pipeline** in Fabric.
2. Adding a **Notebook Activity** to the pipeline canvas.
3. Configuring the activity to point to this `Ntbk_Bronze_to_Silver_Customers` notebook.
4. Setting a **Schedule** for the pipeline to run automatically (e.g., daily, hourly).

This completes the end-to-end process of building a scheduled, automated transformation pipeline in Microsoft Fabric.
